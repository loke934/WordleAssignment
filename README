Container for the words

A set is used to store the words form the text file. Then a check is run to se if the set contain the players input and if so it's valid.
I chose to use a set because it's a fast look up, since it's a binary search tree and all the elements are unique. 
I considered a list but then it would potentially need to iterate the whole list, if I didn't use or write an other search function that's not linear.
A map didn't make sense because the word is both key and value.

For the colored output I used a map for key index and value color, so when it outputs it's used as a look up to determine which background color to output.
